There are 462 individuals in this data and 121 of them have the G|G genotype, 233 have the A/G genotype, and 108 have the A/A genotype. In order to find the median expression levels for all these samples, we can make a box plot and analyze the data. (See below). From the box plots we've made, we can see that A/A individuals have a median expression level of 31, A/G individuals have a median expression level of 25, and G/G individuals have a median expression level of 20. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(expr) + aes(geno, exp) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
>Q14

We can see that expression levels of ORMDL3 are noticeably different for the different genotypes, with A/A being the highest, A/G being a medium expression level, and G/G being the lowest expression level.
